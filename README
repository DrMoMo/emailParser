Hello!

emailParser.py is designed to help with quick triage of an email mailbox that users frequently send
suspicious emails to.  

There are a couple requirements:
1) Python
2) Internet
3) Email Inbox with IMAP access (right now it's set to SSL only)
4) CouchDB server (I haven't put in auth creds yet)
5) a free virustotal.com api key

So, what the script does is this:
1) logs into email box
2) parsers all the messages in that mailbox
3) deletes the emails WITHOUT attachments
5) parses the emails WTIH attachments
6) gets the folling info:
	Date
	Sender
	Subject
	Filename
	MD5
	File Size (haven't done this yet)

7) using the MD5 it then checks it against virustotal.com, if it's not there, then it submits the
file and receives the send_id
8) If it has been seen it gets the results
9) It checks the md5 against the couchdb to see if anyone in the past has sent in the same file then
it grabs that history
10) finally it emails all this data to an email address you choose

INSTALL:
install python and couchdb
add you details to the emailparser.conf file
run configureCouchDB.py #this will setup the database and the required view
stick the emailparser.py script in a cron job to run every 5 minutes

P.S. this is my first contribution to open source, help if you can.
Thanks
